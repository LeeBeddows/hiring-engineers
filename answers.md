Introduction
------------
As part of the hiring process for a role with DataDog - as a Technical Account Manager - I was asked to complete this Solutions Engineer technical exercise.
Hopefully what follows will give you a quick glimpse into my approach to technical problems - as well as my presentation and documentation style.


Prerequisites - Setup the environment
-------------------------------------

The technical exercise instructions recommend starting with a blank canvas - and using a fresh host and OS - which is a sensible approach and provides a level playing field for comparison between candidate submissions.

I chose to fire up a new Vagrant VM on my development Macbook Pro - and use the bento box image to start an Ubuntu 16.04 OS - via the command:    
> vagrant init bento/ubuntu-16.04
